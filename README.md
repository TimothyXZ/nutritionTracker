# nutritionTracker

A web application designed to track nutrition intake.

This is a project I am working on to increase my experience in web design.

Features I plan to include:

  -The ability to input daily values for the food you consume to track the macronutrient content. These values will also be calculated
  to display the average values for each week.
  
  -A page to track your current stock of food, as well as the ability to save the nutrition values for each type of food and utilize
  this to construct a meal plan which calculates the nutrition value for each meal.
